"Answer: Businesses with 2-3 stars are in the same areas as per the postal code 
which is in Eastern part of the city. Businesses with 4-5 stars are in a different area. 

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer."


__SQL code 

SELECT  CASE    WHEN is_open = 1 THEN "OPEN"
                WHEN is_open = 0 THEN "CLOSED"
                END status, 
        count(distinct id) AS num_businesses,
        sum(review_count) AS total_reviews,
        round(avg(review_count),2) AS average_review,
        round(avg(stars),2) AS average_stars
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY status DESC

Answer: 
"Difference A: There are 7 times more businesses that are open than closed.
Difference B: Open and closed businesses do not have much difference interms of average stars, 
this could mean that they were not closed due to poor rating but other reasons."

"3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis."


"i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:"

"The analysis is to find out what are the most successful businesses based on the business category."

" Answer: I choose to analyse preference among different types of cuisines (food) on yelp"
 
 
 "ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:"
 "To conduct this analysis, I will require specific data from the business and category tables, 
 including id, stars, and review count from the former, and category. 
 My analysis will involve determining the count of businesses in each category, as well as calculating 
 the average star rating and total reviews received by each business to gauge their performance. I choose this category  as its a favourite business category within the yelp dataset"
